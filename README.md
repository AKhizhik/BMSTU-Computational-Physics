# Computational Physics Repository

This repository contains laboratory and homework assignments from a computational physics course at Bauman Moscow State Technical University, completed during the academic year of 2019-2020. Each assignment is stored in a separate folder, consisting of a TeX report and corresponding C++ program code.

## Semester 1
### Laboratory Assignments

1. Applying Lagrange and Newton interpolation polynomials for function approximation.
2. Deriving formulas for numerical differentiation of first and second orders for uniform grids using Lagrange and Newton interpolation polynomials.
