# Computational-Physics

This repository contains laboratory and homework on the course of computational physics at the Bauman Moscow State Technical University, completed in 2019-2020.

Each work corresponds to a separate folder, which contains a report written in TeX and the program code in C++.

### Laboratory work

1. Lagrange and Newton interpolation polynomials application for function approximation.

2. Derivation of formulas for numerical differentiation of the first and second orders for a uniform grid in the case of Lagrange and Newton interpolation polynomials.

3. Spline interpolation for function approximation.

4. Calculation of integrals by formulas of rectangles, trapezoids and Simpson, as well as by the Monte Carlo method using methods of reducing variance.
